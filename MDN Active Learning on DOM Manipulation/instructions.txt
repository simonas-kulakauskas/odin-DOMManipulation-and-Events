To complete the exercise, follow the steps below, and make sure that the list behaves as described above.
(✅/❎)

1✅ - To start with, download a copy of our shopping-list.html starting file and make a copy of it somewhere. You'll see that it has some minimal CSS, a div with a label, input, and button, and an empty list and <script> element. You'll be making all your additions inside the script.

2✅ - Create three variables that hold references to the list (<ul>), <input>, and <button> elements.

3✅ - Create a function that will run in response to the button being clicked.

4✅ - Inside the function body, start off by storing the current value of the input element in a variable.

5✅ - Next, empty the input element by setting its value to an empty string — ''.

6✅ - Create three new elements — a list item (<li>), <span>, and <button>, and store them in variables.

7✅ - Append the span and the button as children of the list item.

8✅ - Set the text content of the span to the input element value you saved earlier, and the text content of the button to 'Delete'.

9✅ - Append the list item as a child of the list.

10✅ - Attach an event handler to the delete button so that, when clicked, it will delete the entire list item (<li>...</li>).

11✅ - Finally, use the focus() method to focus the input element ready for entering the next shopping list item.
